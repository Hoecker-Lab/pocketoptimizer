All procedures related to the sampling of either ligand poses or side chain rotamers.

## sidechain_rotamers_ffev

Rotamer sampling with FFEvaluate.

## conformer_generator_obabel

Conformer generation with OpenBabel using either the genetic or confab method.

## peptide_sampler

Generation of peptide conformations based on rotamers.

## ligand_poses

Sampling of ligand poses from the generated ligand conformers.

# Score packing and binding related energies

All energy scoring. This includes protein-protein based interaction-energies calculated from force fields as well as protein-ligand based interaction-energies calculated utilizing different empirical scoring functions.

## sidechain_scaffold_energies

Scoring of side chain rotamers against the fixed scaffold part based on force fields.

## sidechain_pair_energies

Scoring of every side chain rotamer against every other side chain rotamer based on force fields.

## ff_scorer

Scoring of ligand poses against the fixed scaffold part and against side chain rotamers based on force fields.

## smina_scorer

Scoring of ligand poses against the fixed scaffold part and against side chain rotamers based on empirical scoring functions included in smina.
